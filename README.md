# Programming Practice

This repository contains programming practice examples and exercises using the following languages:

- **Vlang**: A simple and fast programming language that focuses on safety and simplicity.
- **C/C++**: A pair of powerful, high-performance languages commonly used for system-level programming and application development.
- **Python**: A versatile and easy-to-learn programming language widely used in web development, data analysis, automation, and more.
- **Cython**: A language that allows you to write C extensions for Python, making it possible to speed up Python code by compiling it into C.

## Languages Overview

- **Vlang**: This language is designed to be simple, fast, and safe, making it a good choice for learning programming fundamentals.
- **C/C++**: Known for their performance and low-level control, C and C++ are essential for understanding how computers work at a deeper level.
- **Python**: Python is known for its readability and simplicity, ideal for quick prototyping and scripting.
- **Cython**: Cython allows you to extend Python with C-like performance for certain code parts, offering the best of both worlds: Python's ease of use and C's speed.

## Setup

Practicing need to have the following languages compiler/interpreter installed:

- [Vlang](https://vlang.io/)
- [C/C++ Compiler (e.g., GCC or Clang)](https://clang.llvm.org/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Cython](https://cython.org/)
